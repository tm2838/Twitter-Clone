# Twitter-Clone

A simple Twitter clone project. 

There are three pages: Main page, login page, and feeds page. 

## Main page

Type something in the input boxes for user name and password and click the login button will lead you to the feeds page. 

Type nothing and click the login button will lead you to the login page with a modal box poping up.

Click either the sign-up button or the login button will lead you to the login page.

## Login page

Same logic as the main page.

## Feeds page

Click 'Post' button on the bottom right corner and a modal box will show up.

Click the user name or the user avatar on top right of the page will trigger a side bar to show up.

In the side bar there is a toggle buttno for dark mode.
